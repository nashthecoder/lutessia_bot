ðŸ“˜ Complete Technical Analysis of the AI Trading Bot
1. Authentication and Secure Configuration
The bot automatically loads API credentials from a .env file using the load_dotenv() function (around line 30). These variables include the API key, Coinbase secret, and email credentials for the 2FA system.

The initialization lines RESTClient(api_key=..., api_secret=...) establish the connection to the Coinbase client. A check with client.get_accounts() ensures the credentials are valid.

Error logs are generated in case of connection failure.

Well-implemented feature.
Possible improvement: add automatic renewal or reconnection handling on failure.

2. DCA Strategy and Buying Logic
The core trading logic is based on the dca_trading_bot() function (~line 13100) and associated functions such as safe_place_market_buy() and monitor_position_for_tp_sl().

The bot:

selects trading pairs (via AI or manually)

checks available USDC balance (get_usdc_balance)

executes a buy order if the strategy validates it

monitors the position via monitor_position_for_tp_sl, with dynamic TP/SL

By default, purchases use 5% of available USDC capital (buy_percentage_of_capital). The AI logic approves or rejects each buy based on the forecast trend via LSTM/GRU/ATR.

Full coverage of automated DCA logic
Possible improvement: integrate centralized management of all active positions for display in the web interface

3. Artificial Intelligence: LSTM, GRU, ATR
Predictions rely on several models:

LSTM: model trained on-the-fly (build_lstm_model, Predictions_calculs)

GRU: lighter, used for short-term, preprocessed with prepare_input_series

ATR: 14-day technical volatility

Predictions are made per pair. Results are aggregated:

ini
Copier
Modifier
final_score = 0.4 * lstm + 0.4 * gru + 0.2 * atr
This score is logged, used to accept or reject a trade, and triggers the early sell strategy.

Functional AI with dynamic training
To improve: add model saving between cycles, show learning curve in /dashboard

4. Dynamic TP / SL & Trailing Stop
The monitor_position_for_tp_sl() function dynamically manages the position after purchase. Take Profit and Stop Loss thresholds are adjusted based on:

Coinbase fees (COINBASE_FEE_RATE)

Assigned series (e.g., series 6 = TP 3%, SL 1.5%)

Observed volatility

A trailing stop is applied: if a new peak is reached, the SL is automatically raised.

Advanced position management feature with continuous adjustments
Possible improvement: parameterize timeout or interval granularity via the Flask interface

5. Strategic Assignment by Series (1 to 9)
Each pair is classified into a "series":

Series 1: high volatility

Series 2: large caps (BTC, ETH)

Series 6: very volatile microcaps

Series 9: emerging pairs (FET, INJ)

Assignment (assign_series_to_pair()) considers:

volatility

trend score

token category

Then, adjust_series_parameters() dynamically adjusts TP, SL, invested capital.

Well-designed system with clear business logic
To optimize: externalize series configuration into a YAML file

6. Flask Web Interface + SocketIO
The web interface is developed with Flask, SocketIO, and Flask-Mail. It allows:

Secure login with password + 2FA (via email)

Real-time bot start and stop via /start and /stop

Parameter configuration via form: capital%, TP, SL, AI enabled, etc.

Dynamic display of logs, balances, orders

Well-integrated and multi-threaded feature
[To optimize] Add CSRF protection, log filtering, and a history/export button

7. Dynamic Account and Conversion Management
The bot automatically detects balances in secondary wallets (ETH, DOGE, etc.) and converts them to USDC if:

their estimated value exceeds a threshold

the amount is tradable (no dust < 0.3 USDC)

Key functions: force_convert_all_to_usdc(), convert_to_usdc(), check_and_convert_all_accounts()

Useful for recycling trade leftovers
[To optimize] Create a conversion tracking page + CSV logs

8. Smart Pair Selection
The system analyzes each pair using:

Golden Cross EMA20 / EMA50

RSI > 50

Volatility over the last 50 candles

AI score (LSTM, GRU, ATR aggregation)

Function: auto_select_best_pairs_from_market() sorts pairs and selects the top bullish ones.

Functional
[To optimize] Add minimum volume threshold, avoid duplicates in fallback selection

9. Logging, Journaling and Alerts
The bot writes logs:

In the terminal

In a logs.txt file

In sales_register.xlsx (Excel)

CSV for series_trade_log.csv and trade_journal.csv

Sends email alerts (via SMTP) on error or extreme PnL

Very complete for auditing
[To optimize] Add log-type filter, export button (JSON/XML/PDF) on /logs

10. Drawdown, Auto-Flat Mode, Wallet Security
A global drawdown is calculated and compared to a threshold (-5%):

If exceeded â†’ automatic bot shutdown (check_drawdown_stop())

Open trades are closed by dynamic trailing stop

Forced sales are triggered at 6 AM (flat mode) or if a position is too old (auto-sell after 2 hours).

Robust security system
[To optimize] Expose parameters (DD threshold, flat time, max holding duration) in the Flask dashboard

11. AI Adaptability: Dynamic Adjustments
Many parameters are adjusted based on:

the trading memory success_rate (TradeMemory)

volatility

trend_score

Functions: adjust_series_parameters(), adjust_capital_by_pnl(), adjust_drawdown_threshold(), etc.

Multi-level adaptive logic (capital, thresholds, TP/SL, score)
[To optimize] Add machine learning to the trade memory + graphical interface for metrics

12. Additional Modules and AI Backup
The bot includes:

Automatic LSTM and GRU retraining every 6h (retrain_models)

AI model saving by pair (saved_models/lstm_{pair}.h5)

Daily backup of logs and trade journals (daily_backup_logs_and_trades())

Advanced features for long-term use
[To optimize] Add hybrid Transformer model (InformerLite is partially present but inactive)
